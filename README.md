# A simple API built using Node + Express

In this project, I build the simplest of APIs using Node JS and Express JS.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Navigate into the repository on your command line and install the necessary dependencies using `npm i`
3. Start the server using `npm run dev`. This starts the server on `localhost:8000`. Test using your browser/POSTMAN.

This project also has a blog written on [Hashnode](https://jnyongesa.hashnode.dev/creating-your-first-api-using-node-and-express-js).
